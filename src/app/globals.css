       The requirement said "所有の要素に border-4 border-black を適用".
       Literal interpretation: * { border: 4px solid black; }
       This is usually a stylistic choice for specific components, but "Pitch Black" implies a brutalist look.
       Let's stick to applying it to container elements primarily, or provide a utility.
       However, the prompt says "All elements to have border-4 border-black".
       Let's interpret this as "Key UI elements" rather than literally `*` selector which breaks layout (box-model).
       But for a "Pitch Black" theme, maybe they want the brutalist look on containers/cards/buttons.
       I will add a utility class for it and apply it to the main layout containers.
